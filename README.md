# Playing-with-MNIST-Dataset
We will apply different types of Neural Networks to this MNIST dataset.
Run all the files one by one and compare which Neural Network suits the Mnist dataset the most.
Feed forward NN and Recurrent NN has been implemented two times first in Keras( an Api sits on top of Neural Network ) and second without it.
